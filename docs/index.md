### Challenges of Working with WordPress for Developers

Using WordPress can present various challenges for new developers. Below are some of these challenges:
### 1. Routing
   The complexity of the URL rewriting system.
   Issues related to setting and changing Permalink structures.
   Interference of theme and plugin rewrite rules with the core WordPress system.
### 2. Lack of a Template Engine
   By default, WordPress does not use a template engine like modern systems such as Twig or Blade. This forces developers to mix PHP code within views, leading to messy and unreadable code and reducing the capability for frontend inheritance.
### 3. Lack of a Designated Place for Writing Logic
   ElegantGlacier is a minimal PHP library designed to integrate Twig templating with WordPress. It provides utility functions that wrap around WordPress functions to make them more readable and maintainable.

# For solving these problems we make ElegantGlacier!
## Installation

To install ElegantGlacier, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your WordPress theme directory.
2. Run the following command to require ElegantGlacier using Composer:

   ```sh
   composer require elegant-glacier/elegant-glacier
   ```

Usage

To use ElegantGlacier in your WordPress theme, follow these steps:
1. Initialize ElegantGlacier

Add the following lines to your themeâ€™s functions.php file to initialize ElegantGlacier:

```php
<?php

// Load Composer dependencies.
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';


// Initialize ElegantGlacier.
ElegantGlacier::init(__DIR__);
?>
```

2. Render a Template

In your template files (e.g., index.php), you can render Twig templates using the ElegantGlacier::render method. Here is an example:

```php
<?php

use ElegantGlacier\ElegantGlacier;

// Render the template.
ElegantGlacier::render('index.twig', [
    'title' => 'Welcome to ElegantGlacier',
    'content' => 'This is a sample page using ElegantGlacier.'
]);
?>
```

3. Create a Template
First create the template directory in the theme folder and then create a `index.twig` file
```
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
```

Utility Functions

ElegantGlacier provides several utility functions that wrap around WordPress functions to make them more readable. Here are a few examples:
getTitle: Gets the title of the current post or page.
```php
 $ title = ElegantGlacier::getTitle();
```
getContent: Gets the content of the current post or page.
```php
$content = ElegantGlacier::getContent();
```
getPosts: Gets a list of posts based on the specified query arguments.
```php
$posts = ElegantGlacier::getPosts([
'post_type' => 'post',
'posts_per_page' => 10
]);
?>
```
## Router
You can also have you own router
```php
use ElegantGlacier\Router;

$router = new Router();

$router->addRoute('GET', '/blogs/:blogID', function ($blogID) {
    echo "My route is working with blogID => $blogID !";
    exit;
});

$router->matchRoute();
```
